Important: This script generates a CSV input file required in the `fip-data` repo
by calculating the min and max values for each required layer from the database.

create_vector_layers_csv.py 

IMPORTANT: See fip-data/legends/vector/README

The headboat layer wasn't in the original list so this was calculated separately later.
